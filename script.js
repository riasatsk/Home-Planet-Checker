And don't even think about trying to grow plants there, because they'd be toast in no time. But if you're a fan of extreme sports, Mercury might be the ultimate destination. You could go snowboarding down the towering peaks of its crater rims, or take a dip in one of its many lava pools for a nice warm bath.

The heat and humidity will do wonders for your pores, and the acid rain will give you a natural exfoliation. Just make sure you pack some goggles and a gas mask, because you don't want to get blinded or suffocated by the atmosphere.
